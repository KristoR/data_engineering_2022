## Assignment
Use the *dellstore* database from the Postgres example dataset.  

We want to figure out, per *country* and *date*, what is the *net amount* that we lose to credit card fraud.  

You need to implement a dbt **macro** and dbt **models** to transform the data accordingly.  

Use **snapshotting** to add new orders and to modify credit cards from invalid to valid.
