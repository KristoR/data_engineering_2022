## Home assignment

You need to create 2 DAGs:
1) "CRM generator"
    Per execution, fetch 5 users from the API at https://randomuser.me/
    Save the users into a csv file.
2) "User age trend"
    Set up a sensor so that the DAG is triggered once the csv file in 1) has been created.
    Save the users from the csv file into a SQL table.
    Calculate the average of the users.
    Use branching to alert whether the average age of the users is increasing or decreasing compared to previous execution.

The assignment is to be done individually.

Deadline: October 13, 2022.

The assignment will not be graded.

The students who present their solution in the session on Oct 13 can earn up to 5 bonus points towards their course grade.
